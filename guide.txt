1) How to use the -Convert CSV to JSON- function:
       You are asked to upload your complete CSV data set which should include 3 files 
       (Inspections, Inventory and Violations). To ensure a correct upload it is necessary
       to strictly follow the given order and upload the correct file. 
       Once the 3 files have been added, you can proceed clicking -Convert and Save-, 
       this will automatically generate 3 JSON files directly in the folder where your GUI is stored.
       It is possible to convert as many CSV data sets as needed and then proceed in analysing one of it.

2) How to use the -Analyse JSON- function:
       You are asked to upload your data set in JSON format following the indicated order of upload. 
       Proceed in clicking -Analyse-. 3 possible options are available depending on the desired outcome. 

	2.1) Inspection score per year:
                 Produces 2 tables showing the mean, median and mode of the inspection score per type 
                 of vender's seating and zip code
	2.2) Violation analysis:
		Produces a table representing the reported infractions per each type of violation
	2.3) Correlation analysis:
                 Produces a regression analysis in order to find whether there is a correlation between 
                 number of violations committed per vendor and their zip code.

3) What is the -Download Tables- function:
       The analysis of the data set produces graphs for easy and quick understanding, 
       but with the Download Tables it is possible to download a JSON version of clean data.
